✔ The basic JavaScript code for checking if a cState-powered status page (using its read-only API).

**There is no UI for this project, so you are you free to write that yourself or [contribute so others can use it](https://github.com/cstate/html-embed/issues/2).**

The `index.js` file has the JavaScript you can add to your page and use for making other things happen.
